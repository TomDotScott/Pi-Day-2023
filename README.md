# Pi Day 2023
 Using a Monte-Carlo method to visually estimate a value for Pi using a unit square, a unit circle and randomly placing points inside!
 
![The method](https://github.com/TomDotScott/Pi-Day-2023/blob/main/Readme%20Image/pic.jpg?raw=true)

After ~2 minutes of execution, with around 5000 points pressed, it comes out with an estimate for pi being around 3.141596 which is a 0.0001% overshoot! Not too shabby!
